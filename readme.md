# dungeon of sdl2

hello, this is an example of SDL2 and GL3, with fews of features (workable tessellator).

# build

To build is easy, just import the build file in sublime_text_build.
I coded this in sublime text so I made this build file.
The program uses MinGW64, anyway this is not a serious project.
